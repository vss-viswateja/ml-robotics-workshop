This code reads a CSV file containing a dataset with columns for ID, weight, and height, then performs basic statistical analysis and visualization. Using the `pandas` library, it loads the dataset from the specified file path and extracts the "ID," "Weight (kg)," and "Height (cm)" columns as NumPy arrays. It calculates and prints the mean values of the weight and height data. Finally, the code visualizes the weight and height distributions using bar graphs, where the IDs are plotted on the x-axis, and the respective weights and heights are plotted on the y-axis. The graphs are titled appropriately, and the axes are labeled for clarity.
