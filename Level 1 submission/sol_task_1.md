A. Key Components of a Robot and Its Applications

Robots are sophisticated machines designed to perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. They consist of several essential components:  

1. Physical Structure: This includes the robot's framework, comprising links and rigid bodies. It forms the mechanical foundation, enabling the robot to perform physical movements and maintain stability.  
2. Sensors/Perception System: This system allows the robot to sense the external environment and monitor its internal state. Information from the sensors is crucial for decision-making, as it guides the controller to act according to the task requirements.  
3. Controller: The controller acts as the robotâ€™s brain. It processes data from the sensors and, based on the given task, sends precise commands to the actuators.  
4. Actuators: These are responsible for actuating the system, enabling the robot to move or interact with its environment as required by the task.  

B. Applications of Robotics  

Robots are widely used in various fields. 
1. In healthcare, robotic systems perform minimally invasive surgeries and assist in patient care and rehabilitation. 
2. In manufacturing, robots automate processes such as assembly, welding, and material handling, improving productivity. 
3. In agriculture, robots contribute to tasks like precision farming, automated harvesting, and crop monitoring.
