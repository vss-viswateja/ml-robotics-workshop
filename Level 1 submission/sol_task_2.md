1. supervised learning is a method in machine learning in which the model learns to predict the output from a given set of example (inputs, outputs) pairs.

2. the main difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is that in unsupervised learning we try to predict a pattern in the data and in supervised learning we try to predict the output from a given set of paired data.

3. reinforcement learning is based on action-reward concept. This is different from supervised learning in such a way that the agent is able to interact with the environment and each of its actions, which is decided by the policy being trained, effect the environment, this  is not seen in supervised learning.
