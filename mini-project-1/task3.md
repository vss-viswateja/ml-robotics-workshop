## **Resources**
- [SpeechRecognition Python Library](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)
- [Google Text-to-Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech)

## **Deliverable**
- A video or screenshots showing voice commands in action.
- Code files and with implementation details should be in `solutiuons.md`.
