# Mini Project: Robot Simulation with ML Integration

## **Overview**
This mini project serves as the culmination of the Machine Learning for Robotics Workshop. You will build a robot simulation that integrates the skills and concepts learned throughout the workshop.

## **Objective**
- Create a robot simulation using tools like Gazebo, Webots, or PyBullet.
- Implement at least three ML techniques:
    - Object detection (e.g., OpenCV or TensorFlow).
    - Path planning (e.g., A* or Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm).
    - Voice commands (e.g., NLP or Speech Recognition).

## **Requirements**
- The project must include:
    1. A robot navigating a simulated environment.
    2. An ML model for one or more tasks (e.g., vision, navigation, speech).
    3. Documentation of your setup, process, and results.
- Submit the project in a GitHub repository with the following:
    - Source code
    - `SOLUTION.md` (detailed instructions, demo videos/screenshots)
    - Any necessary datasets

## **Submission Guidelines**
- Make a directory `miniprojects-submission`.
- Upload your project files and documentation to this folder.
- Share your GitHub repository link in the `#mini-project-submissions` Discord channel.

## **Evaluation Criteria**
1. **Functionality (50%)**: Does the simulation meet the objectives?
2. **Innovation (20%)**: Are there unique or creative approaches?
3. **Documentation (20%)**: Is the project well-documented?
4. **Presentation (10%)**: Is the demo or showcase clear and effective?

## **Deadline**
All submissions must be made by **December 26th, 2024**.
