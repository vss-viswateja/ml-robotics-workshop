# Task 1: Build a Regression Model

## Objective

Predict the robot's future movement based on features like speed, acceleration, and rotation.

## Instructions

1. Load the `datasets/robot_movements.csv` dataset.
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Build a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor).
4. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like RMSE and R-squared.
5. Save and visualize the results.

## Submission

1. Upload your Python code and results to your repository.
2. Submit the link in the `#level-5-submissions` channel.
