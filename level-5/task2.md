# Task 2: Train a Classification Model

## Objective

Classify sensor readings into categories: normal, warning, or critical.

## Instructions

1. Load the `datasets/robot_sensor_data.csv` dataset.
2. Preprocess the data (handle missing values, normalize features).
3. Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
4. Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
5. Save and visualize the results.

## Submission

1. Upload your Python code and results to your repository.
2. Submit the link in the `#level-5-submissions` channel.
