# Level 5: Supervised Learning for Robotics

## Overview

In this level, you will learn the fundamentals of supervised learning and its applications in robotics. You will use datasets to build regression and classification models that predict robot movements and classify sensor data.

### Objectives

1. Understand supervised learning concepts: regression and classification.
2. Implement machine learning models using Python.
3. Evaluate model performance and interpret results.

### Tasks

1. **Task 1**: Build a regression model to predict robot movements.
2. **Task 2**: Train a classification model to classify sensor readings.
3. **Task 3**: Evaluate and visualize the performance of models.

### Resources

- `datasets/robot_sensor_data.csv`: Dataset for classification.
- `datasets/robot_movements.csv`: Dataset for regression.

### Submission

1. Complete the tasks in the respective `.md` files.
2. Push your completed code and analysis to your repository.
3. Submit your GitHub link in the `#level-5-submissions` Discord channel.
