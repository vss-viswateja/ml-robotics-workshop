# Level 4: Computer Vision Basics

## Objective:
1. Learn image preprocessing techniques and feature extraction.
2. Understand basic object detection concepts.

## Tasks:
- **Task 1:** Image preprocessing (resize, normalize, and apply filters).
- **Task 2:** Feature extraction (edges and corners).
- **Task 3:** Object detection basics.

## Datasets:
The datasets for this level include:
- `images.zip`: A collection of sample images.
- `annotations.json`: Object annotations for specific images.

### How to Proceed:
1. Read this `README.md` and the individual task files (`task1.md`, `task2.md`, `task3.md`).
2. Use the datasets provided in the `datasets` folder.
3. Submit your solutions as instructed in each task.

## Submission Instructions:
1. Push your solutions to your GitHub repository under the `level-4` folder.
2. Share your repository link in the `#level-4-submissions` channel on Discord.

## Resources:
1. Image Preprocessing:
    - OpenCV Documentation: [https://docs.opencv.org/](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/index.html)
2. Object Detection:
    - Haar Cascades: [OpenCV Haar Training](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/db/d28/tutorial_cascade_classifier.html)
    - YOLO: [YOLO Documentation](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)

### Notes:
- Focus on understanding the core concepts before coding.
- For any doubts, reach out in the `#level-4` Discord channel.

Good luck!
