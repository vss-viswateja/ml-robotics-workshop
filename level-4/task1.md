# Task 1: Image Preprocessing

## Objective:
Learn basic image preprocessing techniques using OpenCV.

## Instructions:
1. Write a Python script to:
    - Load the images from `images.zip`.
    - Resize all images to 128x128 pixels.
    - Normalize the pixel values (range 0-1).
    - Apply a Gaussian blur to smoothen the images.

2. Save your script as `image_preprocessing.py`.

## Submission:
- Push your `image_preprocessing.py` file to your repository.
- Share the link in the `#level-4-submissions` channel on Discord.
