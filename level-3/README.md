# Level 3: Mastering Basic Math for Robotics

Welcome to Level 3! In this level, you will tackle six essential math questions that lay the groundwork for your success in the upcoming levels of robotics. These questions are designed to test your understanding of the mathematical principles necessary for advanced robotics applications.

## Why This Level Is Important
Mathematics is the backbone of robotics. Concepts such as linear algebra, probability, and geometry are fundamental to understanding robot kinematics, path planning, and decision-making. Completing these exercises will:

1. Strengthen your mathematical foundation.
2. Prepare you for advanced robotics problems.
3. Build confidence in applying math concepts to real-world robotics scenarios.

## Instructions
1. Solve all six questions provided in the **Level 3 Math Questions** section.
2. Submit your solutions via the GitHub repository created for this workshop. Ensure your solutions are well-documented and include all necessary steps.
3. After submission, your solutions will be reviewed. A passing score is required to proceed to Level 4.

## Level 3 Math Questions
1. **Linear Algebra:** Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix:  
   \[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & -2 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \]

2. **Probability:** A robot sensor detects an obstacle with a 90% success rate and has a 5% false positive rate. If the sensor flags an obstacle, what is the probability that an obstacle is actually present? Assume obstacles are present 30% of the time.

3. **Transformations:** A 2D point \( (4, 3) \) is rotated counterclockwise by \( 45^\circ \) about the origin. Find its new coordinates.

4. **Gaussian Distribution:** A robotâ€™s distance measurements follow a normal distribution with mean \( \mu = 10 \) and standard deviation \( \sigma = 2 \). What is the probability that a measurement is between 8 and 12?

5. **Vector Calculations:** Compute the dot product and cross product of the vectors:  
   \( \mathbf{v_1} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}, \mathbf{v_2} = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix} \)

6. **Determinants:** Calculate the determinant of the following 3x3 matrix:  
   \[ B = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -1 & 4 \\ 2 & 3 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \]

## Submission Guidelines
- Save your solutions in a file named `level3_solutions.md`.
- Include your full name and Discord username at the top of the file.
- Push your solution file to the designated GitHub repository before the deadline.

## Tips for Success
- Review relevant concepts before solving the questions.
- If youâ€™re stuck, discuss with your peers on the Discord channel.
- Use tools like Python, MATLAB, or a scientific calculator for verification, but document all manual calculations.

## Next Steps
Upon successful completion of Level 3, you will unlock access to Level 4, where youâ€™ll dive into hands-on robotics tasks involving kinematics and control systems. Keep pushing forward!

Good luck, and may the math be with you! ðŸš€
